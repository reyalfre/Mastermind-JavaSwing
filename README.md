# Mastermind-JavaSwing
The game will generate a random four-digit code that you must guess in 10 attempts (the digits are not repeated). Each attempt will generate a result: a dash ("-") for each digit not matched, a zero ("0") for each digit matched in an incorrect position, and a one ("1") for each digit matched in the correct position.
